# What this app is

I am a Human Computer Interaction student. 

My task for my course project is to create three prototypes for a redesign of YouTube's video player page.

The three redesigns will be deployed on three separate Vercel or GitHub Pages pages for people to click around on.

And so the question then is, what are the three redesigns?

# Three prototypes for UXUI improvements to YouTube

## What is the problem being solved?

Problem statement: People have difficulty finding the hotkeys to use with the keyboard.

Solution statement: Provide enhancements to discoverability via the Settings menu.

Three possibilities:

### 4.1 Design one: “Always show hotkeys” toggle

I will modify the YouTube settings menu to have a toggle for showing hotkeys over the player at all times. I selected this one because it was relevant and simple to implement.

### 4.2 Design two: Click to Show Hotkeys (Briefly)

I will add a menu option that allows the user to  briefly show all hotkeys, until one is pressed, allowing learning to occur. I selected this one again because it addresses a real reported problem and cannot be construed as a bug.

### 4.3 Design three: A manual page showing all hotkeys

I will add a toggleable popup that displays all video player page hotkeys without becoming a chore to read through overwhelm. I again select this option over my initial plan (“focus the keyboard back on the player”) because this problem was reported most often and cannot be construed as a bug.


# A short break to discuss ethics

ChatGPT told me, "don't copy their font, their logo, or imply that the visitor is actually on YouTube."

As you can see from the code, nothing like that has occurred.

In fact, due to the nature of the UXUI change being tested, it's actually *completely fine* if the YouTube mockup only kinda-sorta looks like YouTube.

Think, "somewhat low-fidelity is good here." I am not testing anything concerning aesthetics: I am testing a feature.
